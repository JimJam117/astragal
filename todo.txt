// Fixed issues with links to css/js, as well as general issues with url links, some of which due to use of \ instead of /, some due to incorrect paths
// There was an issue with uploading to the database, whilst deleting and getting information worked fine. In the end I discovered that this was due to there being too many columns in the table I was trying to upload to that were not being set. This was fixed by removing the unused columns.

-----------------------------------------------
when doing MVC:
create a php init file to aid with paths
-----------------------------------------------

Todo now:
	Front end header no longer works, due to some links not using the correct path
	Front end album details page styling is broken


MVC 1.1:

	Object orientated MVC DESIGN instead of procedural

	#move all backend files into a backend files folder
	#create init.php and make sure all the redirects work

	#clean up urls/make sure that invalid input cannot be entered
		for example, right now if you enter in some weird value in a url
		i.e. ?album=words_here it throws a php error


___________________ RELEASE

Instagram/Facebook integration 1.2:

instagram api
facebook api

Other things to do 1.3:
Make a JS carosel for the recent posts and featured images instead of simply displaying them

Make a drag and drop upload thing for uploading images on the backend instead of just the button




---------------------------------------------------------

Finishing up and uploading to web:
	remove error reporting
	w3validator
	Site map XML
	robots.txt
	setup 404 page correctly on server
	php.ini file settings, like max file upload, also pdo enabled etc'
	Domain name
	SSL Certificate



EXTRAS:
search on the backend
	make a search for the all posts and all albums page


------------------------------------------

post release stuff:

	instructional manual

	instagram api
		- Check registered URLs in your social Apps
		- Check API keys and secrets
		- Check if the app is public (Facebook)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRA STUFF:


change font and dark theme (viewer can switch to it in the header)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

______________________________________________________________________________________
ERRORS TO FIX:

	# about me text input box on backend does not show text when changed

	# fix background image upload file size/type

	when updating album details, album description updates regardless of if
	any changes are made (album description success message displays)

	when uploading image, I get this error:
		Warning: POST Content-Length of 10343391 bytes exceeds
		the limit of 8388608 bytes in Unknown on line 0

		maybe remove the size limit for images?

NOTES:
php.ini needs it's maxfilesize changed
front end 404 page, needs to be set up in htaccess
need to make sure unauthorised areas are blocked or lead to 404/unauthorised page
